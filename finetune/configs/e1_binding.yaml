# Configuration for E1 LoRA finetuning on residue-level metal ion binding classification
# This configuration performs direct task-aligned finetuning instead of MLM pretraining

general:
  seed: 1
  gpu_id: 0  # Single GPU ID for training

data:
  # FASTA files with per-residue binding labels
  # Format: {fasta_path}/{ION}_train.fasta where {ION} is replaced with ion name
  # Each file has 3-line blocks: >id, sequence, binary_labels
  fasta_path: "/hpcgpfs01/scratch/xdai/biolip2_latest"
  
  # MSA directory containing .a3m files per protein ID
  # Format: {msa_dir}/{ION}/{protein_id}.a3m
  # Set to null to disable MSA context (single sequence mode)
  msa_dir: /hpcgpfs01/scratch/xdai/msa  # "/path/to/msa/{ION}/a3m_files"

training:
  # Ion types to train on (each gets its own classification head)
  ions: ["CA", "ZN", "MN", "LREE", "HREE", "REE"]
  
  # Training epochs
  epochs: 40
  
  # Batch size (smaller due to E1's large context)

  # Gradient accumulation steps (effective batch = batch_size * accum_steps)

  # Cross-validation settings
  num_folds: 5
  
  # Early stopping patience (in epochs)
  early_stop_patience: 5
  
  # Positive class weight multiplier for BCE loss
  # Higher values give more weight to positive (binding) samples

  num_workers: 2
  
  # Output directory
  output_dir: "results/e1_binding"
  
  # DDP settings (for multi-GPU training via torchrun)
  # Set to true because only one classification head is used per forward pass
  ddp_find_unused_parameters: true
  
  # MSA sampling parameters
  # These control how context sequences are sampled from MSA files
  msa_sampling:
    max_num_samples: 64  # Maximum context sequences to sample from MSA
    max_token_length: 8192  # Maximum total tokens (context + query)
    max_query_length: 1024  # Maximum query sequence tokens (O(n²) attention)
    max_query_similarity: 0.95  # Max similarity of context to query
    min_query_similarity: 0.0  # Min similarity of context to query
    neighbor_similarity_lower_bound: 0.8  # Similarity threshold for weighting

model:
  # E1 model checkpoint
  # Options: "Synthyra/Profluent-E1-600M", "Profluent-Bio/E1-600m"
  checkpoint: "Synthyra/Profluent-E1-600M"
  
  # Dropout rate for classification heads
  dropout: 0.3

# LoRA configuration for efficient finetuning
lora:
  r: 8  # LoRA rank (lower = fewer parameters, higher = more capacity)
  alpha: 16  # LoRA alpha (scaling factor, typically 2x rank)
  lora_dropout: 0.2  # Dropout within LoRA layers
  bias: "none"  # Whether to train bias: "none", "all", or "lora_only"
  
  # Target modules for LoRA
  # E1 architecture modules that can be targeted:
  # - Attention: q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj
  # - MLP: w1, w2, w3

    - "k_proj"

# Notes:
# 
# Data Requirements:
# 1. FASTA files at {fasta_path}/{ION}_train.fasta with format:
#    >protein_id
#    PROTEIN_SEQUENCE
#    0100110...  (binary labels, same length as sequence)
#
# 2. MSA files (optional) at {msa_dir}/{ION}/{protein_id}.a3m
#    Generated using tools like MMseqs2 or HHblits
#
# Memory Usage:
# - E1-600M requires ~8-12GB GPU memory with batch_size=2
# - Reduce batch_size or max_token_length if OOM occurs
# - Enable gradient_checkpointing in model config for large sequences
#
# Expected Performance:
# - Should improve over baseline BCE with frozen embeddings
# - LoRA provides efficient finetuning with ~0.1% trainable parameters
# - MSA context typically improves performance on diverse protein families
