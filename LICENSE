10. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing Profluent-E1 or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this Agreement. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

11. Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement will commence upon Your acceptance of this Agreement or access to Profluent-E1 and will continue in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions herein. Profluent may terminate this Agreement if You are in breach of any term or condition of this Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement, you shall delete and cease use of Profluent-E1. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity obligations, limitations of liability and provisions regarding dispute resolution.

12. General.

    12.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and Profluent relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all proposals, understandings, or discussions, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and all past dealing or industry custom. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights.

    12.2 Profluent may amend or modify this Agreement from time to time and will use reasonable efforts to provide You with notice of any material changes that may negatively impact Your use of Profluent-E1 through the GitHub Page or through another means made available to You. No other changes, modifications or waivers to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties.

    12.3 You and Profluent are independent contractors, and nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute either party as the agent or representative of the other or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.

    12.4 You shall comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all applicable export laws, restrictions and regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and any other applicable U.S. and foreign authority.

    12.5 This Agreement and the rights and obligations herein may not be assigned or transferred, in whole or in part, by You without the prior written consent of Profluent. Any assignment in violation of this provision is void. Profluent may freely assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.

    12.6 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof, and without regard to the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.

    12.7 If You have a Claim, You agree to provide Profluent with at least sixty (60) days' written notice so that the parties may attempt to resolve the Claim internally before requesting arbitration. In case of any Claims or disputes between You and Profluent that cannot be resolved through informal internal discussions, You agree that, subject to the provisions of this section, any and all Claims will be settled by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the AAA Rules by an arbitrator selected pursuant to the AAA Rules; provided, however, that Claims arising out of or relating to Your violations of Profluent's intellectual property rights, including copyright infringement, patent infringement, trademark infringement, or efforts to use Profluent-E1 in unauthorized ways will not be subject to such obligation for settlement by final and binding arbitration, and such claims will instead be brought in the state and federal courts of Alameda County, California. The arbitrator's decision and award will be non-appealable and may be entered in, and will be enforceable in, any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration will take place in Alameda County, California. Each party will bear its own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs otherwise. The arbitrator may not award relief or damages in excess of or contrary to what this Agreement provides, or order consolidation or arbitration on a class-wide or representative basis.

    12.8 If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement otherwise remains in full force and effect and enforceable.
